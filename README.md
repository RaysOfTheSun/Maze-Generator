# Maze-Generator
A simple implementation of the recursive back tracker algorithm that uses depth-first search (DFS) to construct a maze in a given area. This also shows an implementation of the A* path finding algorithm to solve the randomly generated maze.
# Algorithms #
* [Recursive Bactracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker) was used for maze generation <br/>
* [A* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) was used for the path finding aspect of this project <br />
# Notes #
* This project is implemented in Python and Java Script. The source code for each can be found in their respective directories
